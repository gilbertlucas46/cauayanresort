  phcontent: "### Our Philosophy\nWe remember the first time we laid our eyes on this island. Since then, we made it our lifegoal to translate the amazement and humility of witnessing such beauty in the experiences we have to offer—from world-class customer service to redefined meaning of luxury accommodation. Here at Cauayan Island Resort, we wish to bring you closer to El Nido, and perhaps, help you rekindle your passion for life, if not, ignite it further. \r\rThey say people leave a piece of themselves to every place they travel to. With us, we promise to do otherwise: you’ll take every bit of experience here at Cauayan with you wherever you go. It’s the kind of connection we wish to bring. It is the connection we, ourselves, have with the island."
