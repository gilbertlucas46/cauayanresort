  phcontent: "### Our Philosophy\nWe remember the first time we laid our eyes on this island. Since then, we made it our lifegoal to translate the amazement and humility of witnessing such beauty in the experiences we have to offer—from world-class customer service to redefined meaning of luxury accommodation. Here at Cauayan Island Resort, we wish to bring you closer to El Nido, and perhaps, help you rekindle your passion for life, if not, ignite it further. \r\rThey say people leave a piece of themselves to every place they travel to. With us, we promise to do otherwise: you’ll take every bit of experience here at Cauayan with you wherever you go. It’s the kind of connection we wish to bring. It is the connection we, ourselves, have with the island."

    laborum."




    Section 1.10.32 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45
    BC




    "Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium
    doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore
    veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim

    1914 translation by H. Rackham




    "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
    and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the
    system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth,
    the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
    pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know
    how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
    painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
    pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
    occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a
    trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
    except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault
    with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
    consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"




    Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45
    BC




    "At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis
    praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas
    molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt
    in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum
    fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero
    tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus
    id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis
    dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut
    rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et
    molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente
    delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut
    perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."




    1914 translation by H. Rackham




    "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men
    who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
    so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are
    bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
    through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from
    toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In
    a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing
    prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
    welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to
    the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur
    that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man
    therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he
    rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures
    pains to avoid worse pains."
